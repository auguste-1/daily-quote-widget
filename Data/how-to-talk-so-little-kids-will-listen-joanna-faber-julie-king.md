> Tool #1 for Handling emotions: Acknowledge feeling with words. - Grit your teeth and resist the urge to immediately contradict him! - Think about the emotion he is feeling - Name the emotion and put it in a sentence
> 
> With any luck you will see the intensity of the bad feelings diminish dramatically.

> Good feelings can't come in until the bad feelings are let out. If you try to stuff those bad feelings back in, they will marinate and become more potent.

> When a conversation was turning to conflict, my mother used to gesture wiping a slate clean and say, "Erase and start again!" Some parents in my groups have used the word Rewind! as they walk backward out of a room and then reenter with more accepting words.
> 
> What would be the modern equivalent of asking for a second chance? Perhaps yelling "Control Alt Delete!" or "Reset!" with the motion of a finger pressing an imaginary button?

> All feelings can be accepted. Some actions must be limited!

> Sit on those "buts." It is so very tempting to follow up a perfectly lovely statement accepting a feeling with the word BUT. We worry that our kids will think we approve of their negative behavior when we acknowledge a negative feeling. So we sabotage our good intentions by saying: - "I understand you are furious, BUT you cannot hit your sister!" - "I hear how upset you are about your brother wrecking your Legos, BUT you have to understand, he's just a baby." - "I know you want to stay and play, BUT it's time to pick up your brother." - "I know you're in the mood for chocolate chip cookies, BUT we don't have any in the house."

> "But" takes away the gift you've just given. It's like saying, "I hear how you feel and now I am going to explain to you why that feeling is wrong."
> 
> Imagine hearing someone say, "I am so sorry your mother passed away. But hey, she's dead, you're alive, tears won't change it; let's move on!"

> Replace "but" with "The problem is…" or "Even though you know…"

> Tool #2 for Handling emotions: Acknowledge feelings with writing. Seeing their feelings and desires written down in black and white can be very powerful, even for prereaders. Carry paper and pencil when you go shopping so that you can add to your child's "wish list."

> Tool #3 for Handling emotions: Acknowledge feeling with art. This time I said, "This is frustrating! You don't like the trains coming apart." He looked at me and didn't scream. I had a blackboard next to the table, so I grabbed it and said, "Let's draw how you feel." I drew a sad face. "Is this how you feel?" He nodded.
> 
> I made a tear coming out of the eye and he said, "Draw another one." I drew more tears. He reached for the chalk and I could see him get a little glimmer in his eye. He drew some gigantic tears. Then I drew another face that wasn't quite as sad. Benjamin had the hint of a smile at this point so I drew a happy face. He started giggling. We went back to playing with the trains. Tantrum averted.

> Match the emotion. Be dramatic! "I told my son, Thomas, 'You seem angry?' Thomas reacted with annoyance, 'I don't seem angry. I AM angry!'"
> 
> When I heard Toni's calm soothing tone, I said, "Aha! Your words are telling me you understand, but your tone is telling me to calm down. There is nothing so infuriating as being told to calm down when you're angry."

> This time instead of trying to calm him I got loud. I said dramatically, "You want to keep riding your bike!" He said, "Yes," with a trembling lip, holding back tears. I said, "Who cares if it's dinnertime? I bet you'd be happy to eat while riding!" Another "yes" from Benny.
> 
> "I bet you'd like to ride that bike in bed when it's time to go to sleep! You'd ride it in your dreams." "Yes" again, but now he'd stopped crying and was looking at me with curiosity. "You'd be happy to ride your bike underwater at your swimming lesson tomorrow!" Now he was laughing. And just like that, our little guy came in to dinner.

> Tool #4 for Handling emotions: Give in Fantasy What You Cannot Give in Reality. As I was driving Sophia to preschool one morning she started whining, "I hate the new house!" I know that little kids don't like change, and that it was natural for her to be upset about the move, but that didn't stop my instant irritation. I snapped at her to stop whining. Then I launched into a lecture about how the old apartment was way too small, and in a bad neighborhood, and in the new house she would have her own bedroom.
> 
> I went on and on until I glanced over and noticed that she was crying. That brought me up short. "Boy, you really don't like the new house. You would choose a different house?" She said, "YEAH!" "What if you could choose any house you wished? What would your house be like?" "PINK!" "Ohhh, a pink house." "Yes, it would have pink walls, and a pink roof, and a pink bed."
> 
> "How about some pink grass on the lawn?" I offered. "Moo-oom, no such thing as pink grass. But there could be pink flowers." We spent the rest of the ride happily listing all the things in the house that could be pink. The mood was saved. Later on we did buy some pink sheets for her bed. I was able to deliver a happy child to school, instead of a miserable, weepy one.

> Resist the urge to ask questions of a distressed child. Are you sad? Did that make you angry? Why are you crying? Even gentle questions can feel like an interrogation when a child is in distress. He may not know why he is upset. He may not be able to express it clearly in words.
> 
> Often when questioned like this, even adults can feel threatened. We have the feeling we are being asked to justify how we feel and that our explanation may not live up to the asker's standards. (Oh, is that all it is? You shouldn't be crying about that!)
> 
> By making a statement instead of asking a question, we accept the feelings without requiring any justification. You don't have to figure out the cause of the feelings in order to empathize. You can say, "You seem sad." "Something upset you." Or even just, "Something happened." That kind of phrase invites your child to talk if she feels like it, but also gives comfort if she doesn't feel like talking.
