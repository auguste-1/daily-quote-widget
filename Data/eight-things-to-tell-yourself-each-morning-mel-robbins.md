- According to Mel, your brain has a filter called the RAS (Reticular Activating System) that decides what gets your attention, and when you use these affirmations, you train your RAS to notice more opportunities, confidence, and growth. You're essentially setting up what data your brain prioritizes throughout the day. When you tell yourself "something cool is going to happen," you're configuring your mental filters to spot positive opportunities rather than just risks and problems.

- Something cool is going to happen to me today.

- It's going to be a great day today.

- No matter what happens today, I can handle it.

- An exciting new chapter in my life is beginning.

- I need to give myself more credit for how hard I'm trying.

- I'm allowed to be a work in progress.

- If I keep showing up, life will reward me.

- I have something important to contribute to the world. My contribution is significant and important.

- I love me.
