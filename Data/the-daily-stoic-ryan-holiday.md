> "Just as the nature of rational things has given to each person their rational powers, so it also gives us this power—just as nature turns to its own purpose any obstacle or any opposition, sets its place in the destined order, and co-opts it, so every rational person can convert any obstacle into the raw material for their own purpose." – Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.35

> What things do you think have been holding you back that, in fact, can be a hidden source of strength? – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 16th

> "For nothing outside my reasoned choice can hinder or harm it—my reasoned choice alone can do this to itself. If we would lean this way whenever we fail, and would blame only ourselves and remember that nothing but opinion is the cause of a troubled mind and uneasiness, then by God, I swear we would be making progress." – Epictetus, Discourses, 3.19.2-3

> Today, see if you can go without blaming a single person or single thing. Someone messes up your instructions—it's on you for expecting anything different. Someone says something rude—it's your sensitivity that interpreted their remark this way. Your stock portfolio takes a big loss—what did you expect making such a big bet? Why are you checking the market day to day anyway?
> 
> Whatever it is, however bad it may be, see whether you can make it a whole day laying it all on your reasoned choice. If you can't make it for a day, see if you can make it for an hour. If not for an hour, then for ten minutes. Start where you need to. Even one minute without playing the blame game is progress in the art of living. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 17th

> "A good person is invincible, for they don't rush into contests in which they aren't the strongest. If you want their property, take it—take also their staff, profession, and body. But you will never compel what they set out for, nor trap them in what they would avoid. For the only contest the good person enters is that of their own reasoned choice. How can such a person not be invincible?" – Epictetus, Discourses, 3.6.5-7

> Some people think that "choosing your battles" is weak or calculating. How could reducing the amount of times we fail or minimizing the number of needless injuries inflicted upon us be weak? How is that a bad thing?
> 
> As the saying goes, discretion is the better part of valor. The Stoics call it reasoned choice. That means be reasonable! Think hard before choosing, and make yourself unbeatable. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 18th

> "It is said that if you would have peace of mind, busy yourself with little. But wouldn't a better saying be do what you must and as required of a rational being created for public life? For this brings not only the peace of mind of doing few things, but the greater peace of doing them well.
> 
> Since the vast majority of our words and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn't forget at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things? But we must corral not only unnecessary actions but unnecessary thoughts, too, so needless acts don't tag along after them." – Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.24

> "Inwardly, we ought to be different in every respect, but our outward dress should blend in with the crowd." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 5.2

> Outward transformation—in our clothes, in our cars, in our grooming—might feel important but is superficial compared with the inward change. That's the change that only we know about. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 20th

> "It's ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and miserable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul will never be at rest—by longing for things to come it will lose the ability to enjoy present things." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 98.5b-6a

> The way we nervously worry about some looming bad news is strange if you think about it. By definition, the waiting means it hasn't happened yet, so that feeling bad in advance is totally voluntary. But that's what we do: chewing our nails, feeling sick to our stomachs, rudely brushing aside the people around us. Why? Because something bad might occur soon.
> 
> The pragmatist, the person of action, is too busy to waste time on such silliness. The pragmatist can't worry about every possible outcome in advance. Think about it. Best case scenario—if the news turns out to be better than expected, all this time was wasted with needless fear. Worst case scenario—we were miserable for extra time, by choice.
> 
> And what better use could you make of that time? A day that could be your last—you want to spend it in worry? In what other area could you make some progress while others might be sitting on the edges of their seat, passively awaiting some fate? Let the news come when it does. Be too busy working to care. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 21st

> "It is essential for you to remember that the attention you give to any action should be in due proportion to its worth, for then you won't tire and give up, if you aren't busying yourself with lesser things beyond what should be allowed." – Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.32b

> Don't spend your time (the most valuable and least renewable of all your resources) on the things that don't matter. What about the things that don't matter but you're absolutely obligated to do? Well, spend as little time and worry on them as possible.
> 
> If you give things more time and energy than they deserve, they're no longer lesser things. You've made them important by the life you've spent on them. And sadly, you've made the important things—your family, your health, your true commitments—less so as a result of what you've stolen from them. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 22nd

> "Therefore, explain why a wise person shouldn't get drunk—not with words, but by the facts of its ugliness and offensiveness. It's most easy to prove that so-called pleasures, when they go beyond proper measure, are but punishments." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 83.27

> That's why the Stoics don't say, "Stop doing this, it's a sin." Instead they say, "Don't do this because it will make you miserable." They don't say, "Pleasure isn't pleasurable." They say, "Endless pleasure becomes its own form of punishment."
> 
> Their methods of persuasion hew the line in The 48 Laws of Power: "Appeal to People's Self-Interest Never to Their Mercy or Gratitude." If you find yourself trying to persuade someone to change or do something differently, remember what an effective lever self-interest is. It's not that this or that is bad, it's that it is in their best interest to do it a different way. And show them—don't moralize.
> 
> And what happens when you apply this way of thinking to your own behavior? – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 23rd

> "I'll never be ashamed to quote a bad writer with a good saying." – Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 11.8

> But this is true to form for Seneca. He was looking for wisdom, period. It didn't matter where it came from. This is something that a lot of fundamentalists—in religion, philosophy, anything—seem to miss.
> 
> Who cares whether some bit of wisdom is from a Stoic, who cares whether it perfectly jibes with Stoicism? What matters is whether it makes your life better, whether it makes you better. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 24th

> "Won't you be walking in your predecessors' footsteps? I surely will use the older path, but if I find a shorter and smoother way, I'll blaze a trail there. The ones who pioneered these paths aren't our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone, it hasn't been monopolized." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 33.11

> "I was shipwrecked before I even boarded... the journey showed me this—how much of what we have is unnecessary, and how easily we can decide to rid ourselves of these things whenever it's necessary, never suffering the loss." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 87.1

> Zeno joked, "Now that I've suffered shipwreck, I'm on a good journey," or according to another account "You've done well, Fortune, driving me thus to philosophy," he reportedly said.
> 
> The Stoics weren't being hypothetical when they said we ought to act with a reverse clause and that even the most unfortunate events can turn out to be for the best. The entire philosophy is founded on that idea! – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 26th

> "Heraclitus would shed tears whenever he went out in public—Democritus laughed. One saw the whole as a parade of miseries, the other of follies. And so, we should take a lighter view of things and bear them with an easy spirit, for it is more human to laugh at life than to lament it." – Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 15.2

> The Stoics saw little purpose in getting angry or sad about things that are indifferent to our feelings. Especially when those feelings end up making us feel worse. It's also another bit of evidence that the Stoics were hardly some depressing, bitter group of old men.
> 
> Even when things were really bad, when the world made them want to weep in despair or rage, they chose to laugh about it. Like Democritus, we can make that same choice. There is more humor than hate to be found in just about every situation. And at least humor is productive—making things less heavy, not more so. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 27th

> "The founder of the universe, who assigned to us the laws of life, provided that we should live well, but not in luxury. Everything needed for our well-being is right before us, whereas what luxury requires is gathered by many miseries and anxieties. Let us use this gift of nature and count it among the greatest things." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 119.15b

> Seneca's response to this criticism is pretty simple: he might have wealth, but he didn't need it. He wasn't dependent on it or addicted to it. Nor, despite his large bank account, was he considered to be anything close to Rome's most lavish spenders and pleasure hunters.
> 
> Whether his rationalization was true or not (or whether he was a tad hypocritical), his is a decent prescription for navigating today's materialistic and wealth-driven society. This is the pragmatic instead of the moralistic approach to wealth. We can still live well without becoming slaves to luxury.
> 
> And we don't need to make decisions that force us to continue to work and work and work and drift further from study and contemplation in order to get more money to pay for the things we don't need. There is no rule that says financial success must mean that you live beyond your means. Remember: humans can be happy with very little. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 28th

> "No person has the power to have everything they want, but it is in their power not to want what they don't have, and to cheerfully put to good use what they do have." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 123.3

> Is there a person so rich that there is literally nothing they can't afford? Surely there isn't. Even the richest people regularly fail in their attempts to buy elections, to purchase respect, class, love, and any number of other things that are not for sale.
> 
> If obscene wealth will never get you everything you want, is that the end of it? Or is there another way to solve for that equation? To the Stoics, there is: by changing what it is that you want. By changing how you think, you'll manage to get it.
> 
> John D. Rockefeller, who was as rich as they come, believed that "a man's wealth must be determined by the relation of his desires and expenditures to his income. If he feels rich on $10 and has everything he desires, he really is rich." You could take the shortcut and just want less. Today, you could try to increase your wealth, or you could take the shortcut and just want less. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 29th

> "Anything that must yet be done, virtue can do with courage and promptness. For anyone would call it a sign of foolishness for one to undertake a task with a lazy and begrudging spirit, or to push the body in one direction and the mind in another, to be torn apart by wildly divergent impulses." – Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.b-32

> If you start something and right away feel yourself getting lazy and irritated, first ask yourself: Why am I doing this? If it really is a necessity, ask yourself: What's behind my reluctance? Fear? Spite? Fatigue?
> 
> Don't forge ahead hoping that someone will come along and relieve you of this task you don't want to do. Or that someone else will suddenly explain why what you're doing matters. Don't be the person who says yes with their mouth but no with their actions.
> 
> Steve Jobs told Business Week in 2005, only midway through Apple's stunning rise to becoming one of the world's most valuable companies: "Quality is much better than quantity.... One home run is much better than two doubles." – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 30th

> "Whenever you take offense at someone's wrongdoing, immediately turn to your own similar failings, such as seeing money as good, or pleasure, or a little fame—whatever form it takes. By thinking on this, you'll quickly forget your anger, considering also what compels them—for what else could they do? Or, if you are able, remove their compulsion." – Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 10.30

> Earlier we were reminded of Socrates's tolerant belief that "no one does wrong on purpose." The clearest proof of that hypothesis? All the times we did wrong without malice or intention. Remember them? The time you were rude because you hadn't slept in two days. The time you acted on bad information. The time you got carried away, forgot, didn't understand. The list goes on and on.
> 
> This is why it is so important not to write people off or brand them as enemies. Be as forgiving of them as you are of yourself. Cut them the same slack you would for yourself so that you can continue to work with them and make use of their talents. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, July 3rd

> Think about someone you know who has character of granite. Why are they so dependable, trustworthy, excellent? Why do they have a sterling reputation? You might see a pattern: consistency. They are honest not only when it's convenient. They are not only there for you when it counts. The qualities that make them admirable come through in every action ("arise with every mental impulse"). – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 15th

> You become the sum of your actions, and as you do, what flows from that—your impulses—reflect the actions you've taken. Choose wisely. – Ryan Holiday, The Daily Stoic, August 15th
