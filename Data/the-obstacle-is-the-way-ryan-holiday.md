# The Obstacle is the Way

> There are hidden advantages in every situation, that businesses and teams and people can take seemingly impossible situations and find ways to triumph over them. "Hard times can be softened," Seneca writes in one of his essays, "tight squeezes widened, and heavy loads made lighter for those who can apply the right pressure."

> When the Stoics said that there was an opportunity in every obstacle, what they meant was the opportunity to practice virtue. To be a good person despite the bad things that have happened. To do good in the world despite the bad that has befallen you. They were speaking of the idea of arete. Excellence—in all forms.

> How great it is, then, in the face of abundance to be humble, to be disciplined, to be decent, to be generous, to hold true to your values.

> Being underestimated is usually an advantage—however frustrating it can feel in the moment.

> "A writer—and, I believe, generally all persons—must think that whatever happens to him or her is a resource," the great Jorge Luis Borges once explained. "All things have been given to us for a purpose, and an artist must feel this more intensely. All that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art."

> Marcus Aurelius: "Our actions may be impeded... but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. And then he concluded with powerful words destined for maxim. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."

> We blame our bosses, the economy, our politicians, other people, or we write ourselves off as failures or our goals as impossible. When really only one thing is at fault: our attitude and approach.

> Andy Grove, former CEO of Intel, outlined when he described what happens to businesses in tumultuous times: "Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them."

> Not: This is not so bad. But: I can make this good.

> The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.

> "The Things which hurt," Benjamin Franklin wrote, "instruct."

> Many of our problems come from having too much: rapid technological disruption, junk food, traditions that tell us the way we're supposed to live our lives. We're soft, entitled, and scared of conflict. Great times are great softeners. Abundance can be its own obstacle, as many people can attest.

> "Objective judgment, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptance—now at this very moment—of all external events. That's all you need." – Marcus Aurelius

> Overcoming obstacles is a discipline of three critical steps. It begins with how we look at our specific problems, our attitude or approach; then the energy and creativity with which we actively break them down and turn them into opportunities; finally, the cultivation and maintenance of an inner will that allows us to handle defeat and difficulty.
> 
> It's three interdependent, interconnected, and fluidly contingent disciplines: Perception, Action, and the Will.

> You will come across obstacles in life—fair and unfair. And you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure. You will learn that this reaction determines how successful we will be in overcoming—or possibly thriving because of—them.

> Where one person sees a crisis, another can see opportunity. Where one is blinded by success, another sees reality with ruthless objectivity. Where one loses control of emotions, another can remain calm.
> 
> Desperation, despair, fear, powerlessness—these reactions are functions of our perceptions. You must realize: Nothing makes us feel this way; we choose to give in to such feelings. Or, like Rockefeller, choose not to.

> Rockefeller became obscenely wealthy but that's not the kind of wealth the Stoics were after. "The greatest empire," Seneca—an adviser to emperors and a wealthy man himself—would say, "is command of yourself."
> 
> Rockefeller ruled over an enormous business empire, but first and foremost, at least when it comes to the art of the market, he ruled over himself. Each of us has this power. We can learn to see all things rationally. Or better, like Rockefeller, we can see opportunity everywhere, including a disaster, and transform negative situations into an education, a skill set, or a fortune.

> There are a few things to keep in mind when faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. We must try:
> 
> To be objective. To control emotions and keep an even keel. To choose to see the good in a situation. To steady our nerves. To ignore what disturbs or limits others. To place things in perspective. To revert to the present moment. To focus on what can be controlled.
> 
> This is how you see the opportunity within the obstacle. It does not happen on its own. It is a process—one that results from self-discipline and logic.

> It took nineteen years and two trials to overturn that verdict, but when Carter walked out of prison, he simply resumed his life. No civil suit to recover damages, Carter did not even request an apology from the court. Because to him, that would imply that they'd taken something of his, that Carter was owed something.
> 
> That had never been his view, even in the dark depths of solitary confinement. He had made his choice: This can't harm me—I might not have wanted it to happen, but I decide how it will affect me. No one else has the right.

> Just because your mind tells you that something is awful or evil or unplanned or otherwise negative doesn't mean you have to agree. Just because other people say that something is hopeless or crazy or broken to pieces doesn't mean it is.

> We decide what story to tell ourselves. Or whether we will tell one at all. Welcome to the power of perception. Applicable in each and every situation, impossible to obstruct. It can only be relinquished. And that is your decision.

> Don't forget, there are always people out there looking to get you. They want to intimidate you. Rattle you. Pressure you into making a decision before you've gotten all the facts. They want you thinking and acting on their terms, not yours. So the question is, Are you going to let them?

> In these situations, talent is not the most sought-after characteristic. Grace and poise are, because these two attributes precede the opportunity to deploy any other skill.

> Defiance and acceptance come together well in the following principle: There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are high, but the path is there for those ready to take it.
> 
> This is what we've got to do. And we know that it's going to be tough, maybe even scary. But we're ready for that. We're collected and serious and aren't going to be frightened off. This means preparing for the realities of our situation, steadying our nerves so we can throw our best at it. Steeling ourselves. Shaking off the bad stuff as it happens and soldiering on—staring straight ahead as though nothing has happened.
> 
> Because, as you now realize, it's true. If your nerve holds, then nothing really did "happen"—our perception made sure it was nothing of consequence.

> When America raced to send the first men into space, they trained the astronauts in one skill more than in any other: the art of not panicking. When people panic, they make mistakes. They override systems. They disregard procedures, ignore rules. They deviate from the plan. They become unresponsive and stop thinking clearly. They just react—not to what they need to react to, but to the survival hormones that are coursing through their veins.

> "Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself." – Publilius Syrus

> Uncertainty and fear are relieved by authority. Training is authority. It's a release valve. With enough exposure, you can adapt out those perfectly ordinary, even innate, fears that are bred mostly from unfamiliarity. Fortunately, unfamiliarity is simple to fix (again, not easy), which makes it possible to increase our tolerance for stress and uncertainty.

> John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit the earth, spent nearly a day in space still keeping his heart rate under a hundred beats per minute. That's a man not simply sitting at the controls but in control of his emotions. A man who had properly cultivated what Tom Wolfe later called "the right stuff."

> In space, the difference between life and death lies in emotional regulation.

> Can you fight the urge to panic and instead focus only on what you can change? On the task at hand? Life is really no different. Obstacles make us emotional, but the only way we'll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check—if we can keep steady no matter what happens, no matter how much external events may fluctuate.
> 
> The Greeks had a few words for this—Apatheia. Ataraxia. We might call it stillness.

> It's the kind of equanimity and self-command that comes with the absence of irrational or extreme emotions. Not the loss of feeling altogether, just the loss of the harmful, unhelpful kind. Don't let the negativity in, don't let those emotions even get started. Just say: No, thank you. I can't afford to panic.

> As Gavin de Becker writes in The Gift of Fear, "When you worry, ask yourself, 'What am I choosing to not see right now?' What important things are you missing because you chose worry over introspection, alertness or wisdom?"

> The Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who once had both his eyes freeze shut on a solo walk in space, explained that there are always things we can think and do that will make a situation better. But it's worth remembering, he said, "There's no problem so bad that you cannot make it worse also."

> Does getting upset provide you with more options? Sometimes it does. But in this instance? No, I suppose not.
> 
> Well, then. If an emotion can't change the condition or the situation you're dealing with, it is likely an unhelpful emotion. Or, quite possibly, a destructive one.
> 
> But it's what I feel.
> 
> Right, no one said anything about not feeling it. No one said you can't ever cry. Forget "manliness." If you need to take a moment, by all means, go ahead. Real strength lies in the control or, as Nassim Nicholas Taleb put it, the domestication of one's emotions, not in pretending they don't exist.

> You can always remind yourself: I am in control, not my emotions. I see what's really going on here. I'm not going to get excited or upset.
> 
> We defeat emotions with logic, or at least that's the idea. Logic is questions and statements. With enough of them, we get to root causes (which are always easier to deal with).

> We lost money. But aren't losses a pretty common part of business? Yes. Are these losses catastrophic? Not necessarily. So this is not totally unexpected, is it? How could that be so bad? Why are you all worked up over something that is at least occasionally supposed to happen? Well... uhh...I...
> 
> And not only that, but you've dealt with worse situations than this. Wouldn't you be better off applying some of that resourcefulness rather than getting angry? Try having that conversation with yourself and see how those extreme emotions hold up. They won't last long, trust that.

> After all, you're probably not going to die from any of this. It might help to say it over and over again whenever you feel the anxiety begin to come on: I am not going to die from this. I am not going to die from this. I am not going to die from this.

> Try Marcus's question: Does what happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness? Nope. Then get back to work!
> 
> We should be constantly asking ourselves this question: Do I need to freak out about this? And the answer—like it is for astronauts, for soldiers, for doctors, and for so many other professionals—must be: No, because I practiced for this situation and I can control myself. Or, No, because I caught myself and I'm able to realize that that doesn't add anything constructive.

> "Don't let the force of an impression when it first hits you knock you off your feet; just say to it: Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test." – Epictetus

> The phrase "This happened and it is bad" is actually two impressions. The first—"This happened"—is objective. The second—"it is bad"—is subjective.

> In The Book of Five Rings, the seventeenth-century samurai swordsman Miyamoto Musashi notes the difference between observing and perceiving. The perceiving eye is weak. The observing eye is strong.

> Musashi understood that the observing eye sees simply what is there. The perceiving eye sees more than what is there. The observing eye sees events, clear of distractions, exaggerations, and misperceptions. The perceiving eye sees "insurmountable obstacles" or "major setbacks" or even just "issues." It brings its own issues to the fight. The former is helpful, the latter is not.
