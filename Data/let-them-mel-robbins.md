# Let Them

**Author:** Mel Robbins
**Type:** Book

---

> When you say Let Them, you're not giving up or walking away. You're releasing that grip you have on how things should go and allowing them to unfold the way they will go. You're freeing yourself.

> The 5 Second Rule taught me that action is the answer. Thinking about your problems will never solve them. Waiting around to feel like doing something means you'll never do it. No one is coming to save you. You must save yourself from yourself.

> 5-4-3-2-1

> Don't go home to see your grandparents because it makes your mother happy. Go home to see your grandparents because it makes YOU happy to prioritize your grandparents and family.

> When you operate in a way that makes you proud of yourself, it doesn't matter what other people think.

> When you go to your parents because you feel "guilty", you've turned your parents into the villain. When you choose to go because you'd be mad at yourself if you didn't, you're in control of your decisions.

> Let your values drive your decisions.

> Frame of reference.

> People can only meet you as deeply as they've met themselves. Most people haven't gone to therapy, haven't looked at their issues, and they don't want to.

> You are giving other people's opinions too much power. When you let the fear of what people might think dictate your choices, you limit your potential and hold yourself back from pursuing what you truly want.

> Allowing someone else's opinion to distract or consume you is a waste of your time and energy.

> When you let them think what they want, it gives you the freedom to do what you want. When you align your thoughts and actions with your values, you will be proud of yourself. And when you are proud of yourself, you won't care what anyone else thinks.

> Most adults are just eight-year-old children inside of big bodies.

> Why else does your mom pout instead of saying what's wrong?

> Instead of getting frustrated, you begin to understand that most people simply don't have the tools to handle their emotions maturely.

> Let them go silent. Let them erupt. Let them play the victim. Let them sulk. Let them deny it happened. Let them make it all about them.
> 
> Then let me. Let me be the mature, wise, and loving adult in this situation. Let me decide if I want to address this directly or not at all. Let me remind myself that managing another person's emotions is not my job. Let me remove myself from any text chain, dinner table conversation, relationship, or friend group where this is happening.

> Instead of expecting other people to change, demand the change of yourself.

> Let them. And then visualize an eight-year-old trapped inside their body. You pity them. You feel compassion instead of contempt.

> Winning the game of life requires you to focus on the cards you have and choosing what to do with them.

> Research shows that most emotions will rise up, and then fall away, within 90 seconds, if you don't react to them.

> No amount of effort on your part will make these cards magically appear in your life. Here's how you know it's fixed: Is there anything you can do in the next 30 seconds to change this? If not, you are never going to be able to change these things.

> Comparing yourself to someone or some aspect of their life that you cannot change, no matter how much you try, is just torturing you.

> Any time you spend obsessing over a fixed aspect of someone else's life versus your own is an act of self-torture. It is useless for your growth and detrimental to your happiness. If you can't change it, you must learn to allow it. Let them.

> Upward comparison is this tendency to measure yourself against people and their attributes that you think are better than yours. Research shows it destroys your self-esteem.

> You rarely engage in downward comparison, which is looking around and seeing how much better off you are than the majority of people in the world.

> Psychologists will tell you that the root cause of many disorders is an obsessive need for control.

> If you're not careful, comparison can become the reason why you doubt yourself, procrastinate, and continue to stay stuck. You're capable of achieving the same success, but instead of working to create it, you're actively arguing against what you want. This is an example of how you've turned other people into a problem, and they don't need to be.

> There is enough happiness, success, friendship, and money to go around for absolutely everyone, including you. It is in limitless supply. No one is taking anything from you. Happiness, success, and money are waiting for you to get serious about creating them.

> No one else's wins are your losses. That's why you have to change the way you look at other people's success.

> If you are jealous right now about someone else's success, GOOD. I'm happy for you. Jealousy is an invitation from your future self. It is inviting you to look more closely at someone else—not to make you feel inferior, but to show you what is possible.

> Let them wake you up. Let them be successful. Let them dazzle you with their beautiful web design.

> Whoever or whatever is making you jealous, GOOD. Their success and their wins don't shrink your chances of creating what you want. They expand it. Let them lead the way. Flip your jealousy to inspiration. See what's possible through their example.

> Let them make you mad. You need to thank this person that makes you mad, because you're not actually mad at them. That anger that is burning you up inside is you being mad at yourself, because you know that you could have gotten to work sooner, and you know you are capable of figuring this out. You just didn't. This kind of comparison is your greatest teacher.

> How do you flip comparison to inspiration? Simple. Say let me and look at the data other people's successes provide.

> Put in the reps. To be successful, to lose weight, to write a book, to become a YouTuber, you have to show up every day and do the boring, irritating, and uncomfortable work. You've got to put in the reps.

> The truth is you don't have to be special. You just have to be what most people aren't: consistent, determined, and willing to work for it.

> When you focus on how unfair life seems and compare yourself to others, you waste your precious time and energy on things beyond your control. You let others' success paralyze you, leaving you stuck, and feeling behind and frustrated. This mindset fuels procrastination and perfectionism, preventing you from taking action to create your own success.

> There will always be someone who is luckier, has what you want, is further along, or achieves success more quickly than you. Comparing yourself to others is a natural instinct; but when it consumes your thoughts, it undermines your confidence and motivation. You cannot control the success of others, but you can control how you respond to it.

> Let others have their success and leverage it to fuel your own journey. Other people's success is evidence that you can do it too.

> Let them be proof that it's possible. You'll work to achieve the next level of success in your life with much more inspiration and much less resentment. You go from "It's not fair" to "Show me what's possible and I'll show you what determination can do."

> The best relationships of your life are still ahead of you. The most fulfilling friendships, the most beautiful love stories, and the most incredible bonds with family members are still waiting for you if you learn to accept people for who they are and stop trying to force a relationship to be something it's not.

> The more you release your expectations, control, and the need to fix others, the more your relationships will flourish. It's never too late to find amazing friends, make amends, strengthen family ties, or create the love you've always dreamed of.

> The reason why it's so hard to navigate adult friendship is that when you reach your 20s, friendship changes from a group sport to a one-on-one sport—and no one understands this.

> You'll constantly be confronted with the challenge of finding your people in new places and in new chapters of your life.

> For the first 20 years of your life, the structure of friendship was planned for you, by your parents, the school system, sports teams, college dormitories, fraternities and sororities, or extracurricular activities that made it easy for you to be around people your same age.

> Ask yourself, do you want love or do you want control? Because you can't have both.

> The crazy thing is that, most of the time, what you want isn't proof that you deserve to be loved. What you want is a sense of control—the ability to predict the future—and that's the real problem.

> You want to know that you are safe and loved. You believe that if you can control what's going to happen, you can keep the bad stuff from happening.

> "It's not whether or not someone texts you back that makes you anxious. It's not knowing whether or not someone is going to text you back that makes you anxious."

> Not knowing is unsettling, and your need to control people's behavior is rooted in your need to eliminate the discomfort of the unknown.

> Texting creates a false sense of connection. Just because you can reach someone 24/7 doesn't mean you should expect them to respond 24/7.

> If you need to contact someone, pick up the phone and call them. If that feels scary or weird, you're proving my point. This entire thing is built on some sort of weird anxiety, and I'd love for you to feel empowered to rise above it.

> But here's the hard truth: When you make your peace conditional on someone texting you back, you're not actually seeking peace—you're chasing control. And the chase for control is the opposite of peace.

> Everything is training you that if you can just control one more thing, you will feel better, but it has never worked. So stop. Let them take forever to respond. Let your text go unanswered. Let them not reach out first. And for God's sake, let yourself feel a little uncomfortable for a few minutes. You'll survive, I promise.

> Whatever you resist, persists.

> You want to respond in a way that makes you feel good and proud of yourself regardless of how anyone else behaves.

> You get to decide what you allow in your life. The power is yours. You are not a victim to other people's actions or inactions. Say this to yourself three times: They can do whatever the hell they want, and so can I.

> There are three possible responses when someone triggers, hurts, or disappoints you: React (what most people do), Respond (what emotionally healthy people do), or Walk away (what wise people do).

> Dr. Ramani Durvasula uses the analogy of an expiration date on a carton of milk to describe this: If you had a carton of milk in your fridge that was rotten, what would you do? You would throw it away. You wouldn't waste your time or energy pouring it into a different container, or adding chocolate syrup to it, to try to make it taste better. You also wouldn't waste your time yelling at the milk for being spoiled. The milk doesn't care what you think or that you're yelling at it.
> 
> And yet, with people, you spend all this time and energy trying to change them into something they're not. Just throw the milk away. Let them be who they are, but you don't have to accept it in your life.

> The real problem is you don't want to accept the truth. You don't want to throw the milk away. You want the milk to be something it's not. You want the person to change. And that's where you get stuck. The truth is right in front of you: You deserve better than rotten milk. Deep down, you know the truth, and you know what you need to do. You just don't want to accept it.

> Let them show you who they are, and then let yourself believe them.

> Problem: You feel powerless when other people do things that trigger, upset, hurt, or disappoint you. You spend a tremendous amount of energy obsessing over, reacting to, or trying to control other people's behaviors. It's exhausting and ineffective, and it's robbing you of your power. - Truth: You are not powerless. When you lean on the Let Them Theory, you stop wasting time trying to control other people. You reclaim your power by redirecting your focus and energy to the one thing you can control: yourself. - Solution: Let them. And let me. Instead of reacting to other people and what they do, respond in a way that makes you feel good and proud of yourself. This is true power. When you use the Let Them Theory to accept what you can't control (people), you reclaim your power by focusing on what you can control (you).

> The real power is the PAUSE. The space that exists in between the moment someone does something you don't like and your response to it.

> When you are triggered, give yourself just enough time to interrupt your default reaction and give yourself the space to respond on purpose. Now you have the power because you get to choose what you do next. You don't need to react. You don't need to engage in a back-and-forth. If they're not being respectful, you can walk away. You are the one in control of your actions and that is all the control you need in life.

> The Let Me side of this puts the power squarely back in your hands. Let me refuse to engage in back-and-forths that don't serve me. Let me remove myself when I feel disrespected. Let me not return their call if I don't want to. Let me walk away if there are no healthy boundaries in this relationship. Let me say no.

> Now you know the secret. The more you say Let Them, the less you need to say Let Me. When you truly stop caring about what other people think or do, you already know what you're going to do. You've freed yourself by eliminating the only power other people had over you: your obsession with how they act.

> Other people's actions only have power over your life if you give it to them. Let them be who they are. Let me be free.

> Problem: In the wake of The Great Scattering, you've been trying to understand adult friendships using the lens of childhood or school friendships, and it doesn't work. You feel more lonely, isolated, and confused about how to maintain or develop friendships than ever before.

> Problem: The Great Scattering happened and you didn't realize it. You have been approaching friendship the wrong way ever since. You have expected to be included. You have expected to be around your friends all the time. You have expected the text back. That expectation has led to feelings of disconnection, isolation, and uncertainty in approaching new or existing friendships. - Truth: There are three pillars to adult friendship: proximity, timing, and energy. It's your responsibility to understand these three pillars and adopt a flexible mentality and proactive approach to your friendships. You have so much power in your relationships and some of your most favorite people are just waiting for you to go first. - Solution: Using the Let Them Theory, start creating connections without any expectations. You go first. Start saying hello to people around you and building that feeling of community wherever you live today. Sign up for that class. Create the book club. Send the text. One awkward conversation at a time, you will find your people. This approach empowers you to create the most incredible community around you, filled with friendships that are meaningful, supportive, and aligned with who you are.

> Here's the truth: When you push someone, it only makes the person push back. You're working against the fundamental law of human nature. People need to feel in control of their decisions.

> Pressuring others backfires because you don't understand the way people are wired. A human being will always feel like choosing what is pleasurable now, and avoiding what feels painful and hard. That's why no one is motivated to change—even when they know it's good for them in the long run.

> So when you start to push people around, pressure them, or tell them what to do, you are threatening their hardwired need for control over their own lives, decisions, and actions. You're getting in the way of their agency, the feeling that they are in control of themselves, their life, and their own thoughts and behaviors.
> 
> By hinting to someone that "it's a nice day for a run outside" when someone doesn't feel like going for a run, you just threatened them. Your suggestion, no matter how helpful you may mean for it to be, feels like you're trying to take away their right to be their own person who does what they want, when they want. This is why you must let adults be adults. Let them.

> Acceptance of another person, as they are, is the foundation of a healthy and loving relationship. When someone feels that you accept them as they are, they feel safe with you. The opposite happens when you pressure, change, criticize, push, or expect someone to behave differently than they are. This pressure puts you and your loved one in a battle for control, whether or not you realize it.

> If you think about my friend and her husband, who has the control? The husband. As long as he ignores his wife, he's in control of his life, his decisions, and his behavior. The second he does what she says, he loses his sense of agency and she "wins." At this point, the argument is not about exercising anymore, but who holds the power. It also explains why she can't let it go.

> Here's the truth: No one wants to feel pressured by their friends, family, or loved ones. What you want is unconditional love, acceptance, kindness, and compassion. You don't want to be controlled; you want to feel deeply accepted for who you are, and where you are in your life.

> Dr. K couldn't emphasize enough that it needs to be THEIR idea to change, not yours. The husband needs to have a reason to push himself to do the hard work—other than just shutting his wife up. Otherwise, this change will never last, and the resentment between them will just grow.

> Loving people means that you have to meet them where they are.

> Let them live their life. And you know what else you are saying? I trust YOU to figure it out.

> When you accept them as they are, the frustrating and ineffective battle for control ends and you set yourself up to win the war for positive change.

> Decades of research from neuroscientists and psychologists say that you can't motivate someone to change, but you can "inspire" them to change and even make them believe it was all their idea to do so.

> You can't ask someone else to eat healthier while you're raving about the croissant you just ate. But you can influence them if you're always eating healthy meals yourself and raving about how good it tastes.

> The ABC Loop is a tool that I've created, based on combining the best of what experts say will work, and I've put it into a simple formula that you can follow with anyone in your life. In the ABC Loop, you have three steps: - APOLOGIZE, then ASK open-ended questions. - BACK OFF, and observe their BEHAVIOR. - CELEBRATE progress while you continue to model the CHANGE.

> The 5 Whys method was created by Sakichi Toyoda, an inventor and founder of the Toyota family companies, as a way to help engineers uncover the root cause of a particular problem, and it's now taught in business schools and engineering programs around the world.
> 
> The 5 Whys method is a formula that I've used in my life, business, and marriage to help me get unstuck and gain profound insights whenever I've faced a problem I can't seem to solve. In this method, you'll ask "why?" five total times until you feel like you've gotten to a much deeper answer as to why this bothers you so much.

> Pressure doesn't create change; it creates resistance to it. You are acting with the best of intentions, but it is yielding the worst result. Every time you pressure someone, it pushes them away. You are not only straining your relationships, you are fighting against the wiring inside someone's brain and body.
> 
> You think the tension and frustration are due to the fact that the other person won't do as you wish. You are wrong. The tension and disconnection are being created by your pressure.

> The more you try to rescue someone from their problems, the more likely they will continue to drown in them. The more you judge someone for their behavior, the better they will get at lying to you about it.

> The only way somebody gets stronger is by facing the things they feel too weak to face.

> Stop rescuing people from their problems and start acting as if you believe in their ability to face them. Your actions are the loudest and truest form of communication. So when you act in a way that supports someone in facing what scares them, your behavior says, "I believe in you. You can do this. And I'll be here by your side as you face it."

> There were so many questions about HOW to effectively balance supporting someone without rescuing them, I want to share a very specific suggestion almost every expert I spoke with raised. When you are supporting an adult who is struggling, one of the biggest levers you have to pull is what you will spend money for and what you will not.
> 
> If you are giving financial support to someone in an attempt to help them through a hard time, you better be very clear about the conditions upon which you are giving that support. If you give money without conditions, it will lead to massive resentment on your end. The money is not a gift. And unconditional love does not mean unconditional financial support.

> Remember what Dr. Waldinger said? "Don't shield them from the consequences of what they choose."

> The Let Them Theory teaches you that helping doesn't mean solving their problems for them—it means giving them the space and tools to do it themselves.

> Rescuing people from their problems makes them drown in them. When you enable others with your money, words, and actions, you don't foster their independence—you hinder their healing. You prolong their suffering, their debt, their breakdown, and in turn, your own. - Truth: People only heal when they are ready to do the work. You will be ready for them to heal before they are. While your intentions may be good, constantly stepping in to solve their issues creates dependency and frustration, and hinders their ability to take responsibility for themselves. You cannot want someone's healing more than they do. - Solution: Using the Let Them Theory, you must step back and allow adults to face and feel the natural consequences of their actions. Instead of rescuing, offer support with conditions. This approach helps them take responsibility for their own healing and growth, and demonstrates your belief in their innate ability to get better and do better.

> When you say Let Them, you trust and empower others to handle their difficulties while understanding that facing hardship is a necessary part of growth. When you say Let Me, you focus on providing support without taking over while creating the environment and tools necessary for another person to get better for themselves.

> Believe in their ability to heal, and create an environment.

> Never feel bad about asking for what you deserve. Being able to have honest conversations is the foundation of a loving and healthy relationship. So don't fear this, embrace it. If the relationship is meant to be, this conversation will make it stronger. A real conversation only destroys something that is fake.

> The ABC Loop and the power of your influence:  
> - APOLOGIZE, then ASK open-ended questions. - BACK OFF, and observe their BEHAVIOR. - CELEBRATE progress while you continue to model the CHANGE.

> Relationships are about learning how to love someone for who they are, not for who you wish they could be.

> When you say Let Them, you accept people as they are, and you accept their behavior as the truth. When you say Let Me, you choose how love shows up in your life. Stop chasing love and start choosing it.

> The breakthrough moment comes when you realize this: The sky's beauty isn't diminished by the presence of clouds or storms. In fact, it's the variety, the unpredictability, that makes it truly magnificent. The storms highlight the calm; the clouds make the sun more precious. The same is true for your life.

> You've been trying to control the uncontrollable, trying to force the world to conform to your expectations. But what if, instead, you focused on your own response to whatever the world throws your way? You can't change the weather. But you can change how it impacts you.
> 
> No matter what happens around you, you decide how it will affect you. You decide if a comment from a loved one destroys your self-esteem or rolls off your back. You decide if someone else's success makes you quit or inspires you to work even harder. It's that simple. You have the power.

> You are responsible for your own happiness. You are responsible for the energy you bring and how you show up. You are responsible for waking up every day and doing the work to make progress on what matters. You are responsible for defining what matters to you. You are responsible for telling the truth even when it's really hard. You are responsible for paying for your life. Nobody owes you anything, but you owe yourself everything.

> Ultimately your job as a parent is to guide your children to become who they are meant to be, in other words—Let Them.
